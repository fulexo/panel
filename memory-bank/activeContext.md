## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Memory Bank System**: Chosen as primary documentation system for better organization
- **Frontend Architecture**: Next.js 14 with App Router for modern React patterns
- **Backend Architecture**: NestJS for scalable, maintainable API development
- **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL with Prisma for type-safe database access
- **Deployment Strategy**: Docker Compose for containerized deployment

### Design Decisions
- **Component Architecture**: Pattern-based component system for consistency
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance as minimum standard

### Business Decisions
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Single-tenant deployment with tenant isolation
- **Pricing Strategy**: SaaS model with per-tenant pricing
- **Feature Scope**: Focus on core fulfillment features for v1.0
- **Integration Priority**: WooCommerce first, expand to other platforms later

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Patterns
- **TypeScript First**: All code written in TypeScript with strict mode
- **Functional Components**: React functional components with hooks
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extracted into custom hooks
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling at component level
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading and error state handling

### Development Patterns
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Component-Driven Development**: Build components in isolation
- **API-First Design**: Design APIs before frontend implementation
- **Documentation-Driven Development**: Document decisions and patterns
- **Incremental Development**: Small, focused changes with frequent commits

### Quality Patterns
- **Zero Tolerance**: Zero TypeScript errors, zero ESLint warnings
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Code Reviews**: All changes reviewed before merge
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated quality checks on every commit
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking
