        "Maintain a clear separation between carrier-specific logic and the common integration patterns.",
        "Follow the established error handling and retry patterns for API integrations.",
        "Implement proper logging for debugging and tracing carrier API interactions.",
        "Use appropriate data validation for both request and response data.",
        "Handle carrier API rate limits and implement backoff strategies where needed.",
        "Document carrier-specific requirements and quirks in code comments.",
        "Follow the existing patterns for credential management and security.",
        "Implement comprehensive error mapping from carrier-specific errors to Karrio's standardized errors.",
        "Use HTTP client libraries consistently within connectors following established patterns.",
        "Ensure proper handling of carrier API versioning.",
        "Follow established testing patterns for carrier integrations, including mock responses.",
        "Implement proper request/response caching strategies where appropriate.",
        "Keep carrier-specific code isolated within the connector boundary."
