# Manage user accounts

## Introduction

This guide describes how to use the Karrio GraphQL API to register a new
user account and do common account management operations.

## Creating a new user account

Depending on the configuration of your Karrio server instance, registering
a user account may be a single-step operation or it may require email confirmation
to activate the account.

:::info

Karrio automatically require an email confirmation if the an email server is configured.

<details>
<summary>Karrio Email Config</summary>

You can configure your Karrio email server at http://localhost:5002/admin/constance/config/

- EMAIL_USE_TLS
- EMAIL_HOST_USER
- EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
- EMAIL_HOST
- EMAIL_PORT
- EMAIL_PAGE_DOMAIN
- EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS

The `EMAIL_PAGE_DOMAIN` should be set to the domain name of your Karrio dashboard.

### Registration

To create a new user account, use the accountRegister mutation. The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `email`: user's email address.
- `password1`: user's password.
- `password2`: user's password confirmation.
- `full_name`: optionally, user's full name.

```graphql
mutation {
    register_user(
        input: {
            email: "user@example.com"
            password1: "password"
            password2: "password"
            full_name: "John Doe"
        }
    ) {
        user {
            email
            is_staff
            date_joined
        }
        errors {
            field
            messages
        }
    }
}
```

As mentioned above, if the you have configured the karrio server email settings,
the user will receive an email with a link to activate their account.

```
http://localhost:3002/email/YWxleC5taWxsZXIyNEBvdXRsb29rLmNvbQ-axd6yl-ce379fa50ced5079908ab669cabb456a89f441c2
```

The link contains a `token` which is required to proceed with the second mutation, `confirm_email`:

```graphql
mutation confirm_email($data: { token: string;! }!) {
  confirm_email(input: $data) {
    success
  }
}
```

If the token is valid, the user will be successfully activated.

## Accessing information about the authenticated user

The `user` query allows you to get information about currently logged in user.

```graphql
{
    user {
        email
        full_name
        is_staff
        last_login
        date_joined
    }
}
```

response

```json
{
    "data": {
        "user": {
            "email": "admin@karrio.io",
            "full_name": "Admin",
            "is_staff": true,
            "last_login": "2021-12-15T22:32:34.229203+00:00",
            "date_joined": "2021-01-07T23:32:10+00:00"
        }
    }
}
```

## Accessing the private server API Key

The `token` query allows you to get the private key of the currently logged in user.

```graphql
{
    token {
        key
    }
}
```

response

```json
{
    "data": {
        "token": {
            "key": "key_0csfjeroij4i5jo9c2adb1e444lk867"
        }
    }
}
```

You can revoke and regenerate the API key using the `mutate_token` mutation.

```graphql
mutation {
    mutate_token(input: { refresh: true }) {
        token {
            key
        }
    }
}
```

response

```json
{
    "data": {
        "mutate_token": {
            "token": {
                "key": "key_6d956c1f9d093a5d2fd3dc0555452253"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Resetting the password

Resetting the password is a two-step operation. First, you need to call a mutation to
send an email with a unique link to reset the password.

The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `email`: user's email address.
- `redirect_url`: path to a view where the user should be redirected to reset the password.

```graphql
mutation {
    request_password_reset(
        input: {
            email: "test@example.com"
            redirect_url: "localhost:3002/password/reset"
        }
    ) {
        errors {
            field
            messages
        }
    }
}
```

As a result, if there are no errors in the response, the system sends an email to
user@example.com with a link to provide a new password, for example:

```
http://localhost:3002/password/reset?uidb64=Mw&token=ax10pr-af2cc4352f19713547b12ab0dd6c0661
```

The link contains two query parameters— `uidb64` and `token` — which are required to proceed
with the second mutation, `confirm_password_reset`.

The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `uid`: user's db id hashed in base64.
- `token`: a unique token that was included in the link in the email.
- `new_password1`: the new password.
- `new_password1`: the new password's confirmation.

```graphql
mutation {
    confirm_password_reset(
        input: {
            uid: "Mw"
            token: "ax10pr-af2cc4352f19713547b12ab0dd6c0661"
            new_password1: "new-password"
            new_password2: "new-password"
        }
    ) {
        errors {
            field
            messages
        }
    }
}
```

If there are no errors in the response, the password is successfully changed.

## Changing the password

If you wish to change your password as an authenticated user, use the `change_password` mutation.
The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `old_password`: the current user's password.
- `new_password1`: the new password.
- `new_password2`: the new password confirmation.

```graphql
mutation {
    change_password(
        input: {
            old_password: "current-password"
            new_password1: "new-password"
            new_password2: "new-password"
        }
    ) {
        errors {
            field
            messages
        }
    }
}
```

If no errors were returned, the password was changed successfully.

## Changing the user info

Changing an email address or the full name of existing user accounts can be done with a single request.
You need to call the `update_user` mutation.

The mutation takes the following input fields:

- `email`: the new email address to set for the account.
- `full_name`: the new full name to set for the account.

```graphql
mutation {
    update_user(
        input: { email: "new-user@example.com", full_name: "Jane Doe" }
    ) {
        email
        full_name
        errors {
            field
            messages
        }
    }
}
```

If no errors were returned, the email and full name were changed successfully.
