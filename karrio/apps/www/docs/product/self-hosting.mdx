There are several ways you can use karrio :

-   ### [Karrio Open-Source](/product/self-hosting/oss)

    You're a large company with the need to self-host or an engineer looking to use the open-source version.

-   ### [Karrio Insiders](/product/self-hosting/insiders)

    Karrio Insiders is built for large companies with significant data isolation requirements.

## Architecture Overview

karrio has three main components:

1. The first component is the **karrio SDK** which unifies and standardize
   the communication to shipping carriers to one interface. It is designed
   to be extensible to allow integration of additional carrier support.

2. The second component is the **karrio server** which is the backend server
   that exposes a Shipping REST API and a GraphQL API. The server is written in
   Python with Django. It maintains its state in a PostgresSQL database.

3. The third component is the **karrio dashboard** App which implements the user
   interface that operation members can use for manual fulfilment processes.
   the app is a Nextjs application that runs in the browser and talks to the
   karrio server using the REST and Graph APIs.

## Extensibility

The obvious way to extend the karrio server would be to download
the source code and modify it directly. After all it's an open-source
platform. We advise against this as experience teaches us that once
your codebase diverges from the upstreamkarrio , it becomes
hard to keep it updated.

Because of this we advice the development of **Apps** that are
external applications that talk to karrio server using its **GraphQL**
and **REST APIs** additionally, they can subscribe to events using
**webhooks**.

### REST API

Karrio brings a set of APIs to interact with shipping provider services.
You can use the karrio REST OpenAPI to get live rates, generate labels,
track shipments, manage pickups and more.

### GraphQL API

Karrio offer the possibility to store the shipping data related to your
shipping operations in a **database**. The karrio GraphQL API allows you
to access, query and visualize that data.

### Carrier Extensions

In addition to being open source, karrio exposes its low level shipping
SDK that abstracts the shipping provider integration constructs. This allows
you to add your custom shipping carrier integration to the karrio umbrella.
