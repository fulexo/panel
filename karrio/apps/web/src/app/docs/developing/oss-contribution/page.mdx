# Introduction

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make to Karrio are **greatly appreciated**.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the Karrio ecosystem:

- **Answer Questions**: Help other users in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/karrioapi/discussions)
- **Report Issues**: Submit bugs or feature requests through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/karrioapi/karrio/discussions)
- **Improve Documentation**: Fix confusing or incomplete documentation sections
- **Create Pull Requests**: Fix bugs or add new features to the codebase
- **Test and Provide Feedback**: Try new features and provide feedback
- **Spread the Word**: Share Karrio with others if you like what we're doing

## Priorities

When contributing to Karrio, we have different priorities for different types of issues:

| Type of issue | Priority |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Critical bugs (API failures, shipping operations not working) | Urgent |
| Core features (carrier integrations, tracking, label generation) | High |
| Confusing UX (working but not intuitive) | Medium |
| Minor improvements, non-core feature requests | Low |

## Developing

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull requests should be made against. The changes on the `main` branch are tagged into a release periodically.

To start developing locally:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local device
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME`
3. Follow the setup instructions in the [Local Development](/docs/developing/local-development) guide

## Building and Testing

You can build the project with:

```bash
# For server components
source ./bin/setup-server-env

# For UI components
npm i

# Start the development
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

To run and test all flows:

```bash
# For SDK tests
./bin/run-sdk-tests

# For server tests
./bin/run-server-tests

# For a specific carrier integration
# python -m unittest discover -v -f modules/connectors/[carrier_extension]/tests
python -m unittest discover -v -f modules/connectors/fedex/tests

# For a specific server component
# karrio test --failfast karrio.server.[component].tests
karrio test --failfast karrio.server.core.tests
```
