# Pull Requests

This guide outlines our requirements and best practices for creating pull requests for the Karrio project. Following these guidelines will help maintainers review your contributions more efficiently.

## Requirements

We have requirements for PRs to ensure they are as easy to review as possible and to ensure that they meet our quality standards.

## Title & Content

Start by providing a short and concise title. Don't use generic titles (e.g., "Bug fixes"), and instead mention more specifically what your PR achieves, for example: "Fix dropdown not expanding in carrier settings page" or "Add Canada Post return label support".

For the PR description, include:

- A link to any relevant issues or discussions
- A clear explanation of what the PR does
- Any technical details that reviewers should know

## Feature PRs

For pull requests that add new features:

1. **Functional Overview**: Explain how your feature works and how users will interact with it
2. **Technical Details**: Share an overview of the implementation, including any important architectural decisions
3. **Screenshots/Videos**: If applicable, add screenshots or short videos demonstrating the feature (Loom is a great tool for this)
4. **Tests**: Describe how you've tested your feature

## Bug Fix PRs

For pull requests that fix bugs:

1. **Problem Description**: Clearly describe the bug and how to reproduce it
2. **Root Cause**: Explain what caused the issue
3. **Fix Details**: Describe how your PR resolves the issue
4. **Tests**: Show how you've tested the fix to ensure it works properly

## Code Quality & Styling

All submitted code must match our code styling standards:

- Python code should follow PEP 8 guidelines
- JavaScript/TypeScript code should follow our ESLint configuration
- All code should pass the automated linting checks

We use automated checks to enforce many of these standards. PRs that fail these checks will need to be updated before they can be merged.

## Making a Pull Request

1. Make sure your code is on a feature branch based on the latest `main` branch
2. Run the tests locally to ensure everything passes
3. Open a PR against the `main` branch
4. Be sure to check the "Allow edits from maintainers" option when creating your PR
5. If your PR refers to or fixes an issue, add `refs #XXX` or `fixes #XXX` to the PR description, replacing `XXX` with the issue number
6. Fill out the PR template completely

## PR Review Process

At least two members of the Karrio team will review your PR before it can be merged. You may receive feedback requesting changes to your contribution. This is a normal part of the review process.

Once your PR is approved by two team members, it will be merged. For Karrio team members, you should merge your own PRs once you have received the necessary approvals.

## Guidelines for Large Changes

If you're planning a large change or feature:

1. Start by opening an issue or discussion to get feedback on your approach
2. Consider breaking the work into smaller, more manageable PRs
3. For major changes, create a design document outlining your approach

This helps ensure your contribution aligns with the project's direction and avoids wasted effort.
