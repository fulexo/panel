# Self-Hosting

There are multiple ways to deploy Karrio, providing support for customers who want to implement their shipping API infrastructure within their existing tech stack. This guide will help you get started with self-hosting Karrio.

## Architecture Overview

Karrio is built with a modern, scalable architecture designed for reliability and extensibility. Understanding the architecture helps you make informed decisions about deployment, scaling, and customization.

### Core Components

Karrio has three main components:

1. **Karrio SDK** - The foundational layer that unifies and standardizes communication with shipping carriers into a single interface. It's designed to be extensible, allowing integration of additional carrier support.

2. **Karrio Server** - The backend server that exposes REST and GraphQL APIs for shipping operations. Built with Django and Python, it maintains state in a PostgreSQL database and handles all business logic.

3. **Karrio Dashboard** - The user interface that operations teams use for manual fulfillment processes. Built with Next.js, it runs in the browser and communicates with the Karrio server via REST and GraphQL APIs.

### Service Architecture

When you deploy Karrio using Docker, several services work together to provide a complete shipping platform:

```

#### Service Details

- **Dashboard (Port 3002)**: The web interface built with Next.js that provides:

  - Shipment management
  - Carrier configuration
  - Order processing
  - Analytics and reporting

- **API Server (Port 5002)**: The core Django application that provides:

  - REST API endpoints for shipping operations
  - GraphQL API for data queries
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Business logic and carrier integrations

- **Background Worker**: Processes asynchronous tasks including:

  - Shipment tracking updates
  - Webhook deliveries
  - Email notifications
  - Data synchronization

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores all persistent data:

  - User accounts and permissions
  - Shipment records
  - Carrier configurations
  - Tracking information

- **Redis**: Provides caching and message queuing:
  - Session storage
  - API response caching
  - Task queue for background jobs
  - Real-time data synchronization

### Data Flow

1. **User Interactions**: Users interact with the Dashboard or make direct API calls
2. **API Processing**: The API server processes requests, applies business logic, and interacts with carriers
3. **Background Tasks**: Long-running operations are queued for background processing
4. **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in PostgreSQL with Redis providing caching
5. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are propagated through webhooks

### Extensibility

Rather than modifying Karrio's source code directly, we recommend developing external **Apps** that interact with Karrio through its APIs:

- **REST API**: For shipping operations, rate quotes, label generation, and tracking
- **GraphQL API**: For complex data queries and real-time subscriptions
- **Webhooks**: For event-driven integrations and real-time notifications
- **SDK Extensions**: For adding custom carrier integrations

This approach ensures your customizations remain compatible with future Karrio updates.

## Environment Configuration

Karrio is configured primarily through environment variables. The most important ones are:

- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used for security
- `DOMAIN`: Your domain name (for production)
- `DASHBOARD_URL`: URL for the dashboard interface
- `KARRIO_PUBLIC_URL`: URL for the API
- `DATABASE_*`: Database connection details
- `REDIS_*`: Redis connection details

For a comprehensive list, see the [Environment Variables](/docs/self-hosting/environment) documentation.

## Initial Setup

After deployment, you can access your Karrio instance:

- Dashboard: Default at `http://localhost:3002` or your configured domain
- API: Default at `http://localhost:5002` or your configured domain

Default login credentials:

- Email: `admin@example.com`

For production environments, we strongly recommend changing these credentials immediately.

## Integration with Shipping Carriers

Karrio supports multiple shipping carriers out of the box. To use them, you'll need to configure credentials in your environment variables:

- USPS
- UPS
- FedEx
- DHL
- And many more

Each carrier requires specific API credentials that you can obtain from your carrier account.

## Maintenance

### Backups

It's important to regularly back up your Karrio data:

```bash
# Backup PostgreSQL database
docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres -d db > karrio_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Backup configuration
cp .env .env.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
```
