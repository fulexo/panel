# Database Migrations

## Understanding Database Migrations

Database migrations are a controlled way to evolve your database schema over time. In Karrio, we use [Django's migration system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/migrations/) to handle changes to the database structure in a secure and stable manner.

When you make changes to models in your project, these changes need to be reflected in your database. Instead of manually altering the database, migrations provide several benefits:

- **Reproducibility**: Each schema change is tracked and can be reproduced exactly the same way in different environments.
- **Version control**: Migrations work alongside your version control system, allowing you to track database changes alongside code changes.
- **Data preservation**: Proper migrations help transform data from one schema to another without data loss.
- **Collaborative development**: Team members can apply the same database changes consistently.

## Running Migrations

To update your database with the latest migrations, use the following command:

```bash
# In your Karrio installation directory
bin/migrate
```

This script activates the Python environment and runs `karrio migrate`, which applies any pending migrations to your database.

For development environments, migrations are typically run automatically when starting the server:

```bash
bin/start-server
```

## How Migrations Work in Karrio

Karrio's database structure is distributed across multiple modules:

- `modules/core/karrio/server/providers/migrations/`: Carrier and provider related schemas
- `modules/manager/karrio/server/manager/migrations/`: Core business objects like Shipments, Parcels, etc.
- `modules/pricing/karrio/server/pricing/migrations/`: Rate and pricing related schemas
- `modules/data/karrio/server/data/migrations/`: Data models and analytics

Each module maintains its own set of migrations that are applied in sequence based on their dependencies.

## Troubleshooting Migrations

### Migration Conflicts

If you encounter migration conflicts (typically when two developers create migrations simultaneously), you may need to:

1. Roll back to a common migration point
2. Apply the conflicting migrations in the correct order

### Database Out of Sync

When your database state doesn't match what Karrio expects (common after restoring backups or in development), you might see errors like:

```
django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation already exists
```

To resolve this, you can use Django's command to mark migrations as applied without running them:

```bash
# Replace migration_name with the name of the specific migration
karrio migrate --fake migration_name
```

For a completely fresh start in development (warning: this destroys all data):

```bash
# Drop and recreate your database
karrio reset_db
# Mark all migrations as applied without running them
karrio migrate --fake
```

## Customizing Migrations

For advanced users who need to customize how migrations work, Karrio supports Django's migration system including:

- Data migrations (for transforming data when schema changes)
- Migration dependencies (for controlling order of operations)
- Custom migration operations

Refer to the [Django Migrations documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/migrations/) for more information on these advanced features.

## Creating Migrations (Development Only)

When developing or extending Karrio, if you modify model definitions in `models.py` files, you'll need to create migrations:

```bash
# Generate migrations based on model changes
karrio makemigrations

# Apply the newly created migrations
bin/migrate
```

Never manually edit the migration files unless you fully understand the implications. Django generates migrations automatically based on changes to your models, and manual edits can lead to inconsistent states.

## Best Practices

- Always back up your database before applying migrations in production
- Test migrations in a staging environment before deploying to production
- Keep migrations small and focused on specific changes
- If multiple developers are working on the project, coordinate migration creation to avoid conflicts
- Include migrations in code reviews to catch potential issues early
