# Upgrading Karrio

This guide provides instructions on how to safely upgrade your self-hosted Karrio instance.

## Before You Upgrade

Before upgrading your Karrio installation, it's important to:

1. **Backup your data**: Always create backups of your database and configuration files before upgrading.
2. **Check release notes**: Review the [release notes](https://github.com/karrioapi/karrio/releases) for any breaking changes.
3. **Plan for downtime**: The upgrade process will cause a few minutes of downtime.

## Backing Up Your Data

It's important to regularly back up your Karrio data:

```bash
# Backup PostgreSQL database
docker-compose exec db pg_dump -U postgres -d db > karrio_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Backup configuration
cp .env .env.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## Upgrading a Hobby Deployment

If you've used our one-click hobby deployment script, you can upgrade Karrio using the upgrade script:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karrioapi/karrio/HEAD/bin/upgrade-hobby)"
```

The script will:

1. Ask for confirmation before proceeding
2. Check for named postgres volumes to avoid data loss
3. Download the latest docker-compose file
4. Pull the latest Karrio Docker images
5. Stop the current stack
6. Restart the stack with the new images

### What to Expect During Upgrade

The upgrade process will:

1. Cause a few minutes of downtime
2. Preserve your database data and configurations
3. Apply any necessary database migrations automatically
4. Update all Karrio components to the latest version

## Manually Upgrading a Docker Compose Deployment

If you're running a manual Docker Compose installation, follow these steps to upgrade:

1. Navigate to your Karrio installation directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/karrio
```

2. Update your local repository (if you've cloned it):

```bash
git pull
```

3. Update the `KARRIO_TAG` in your `.env` file to the desired version:

```bash
# Example
KARRIO_TAG=2024.12.6
```

4. Pull the latest images:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

5. Stop the current stack:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

6. Start the stack with the new images:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

7. Monitor the logs to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Upgrading Specific Components

If you need to upgrade specific components only:

### API and Worker

```bash
docker-compose pull api worker
docker-compose stop api worker
docker-compose up -d api worker
```

### Dashboard

```bash
docker-compose pull dashboard
docker-compose stop dashboard
docker-compose up -d dashboard
```

## Troubleshooting Upgrades

### Database Migration Issues

If you encounter issues with database migrations:

```bash
# Check the API logs for migration errors
docker-compose logs api

# Manually run migrations if needed
docker-compose exec api karrio migrate
```

### Version Compatibility

If you encounter compatibility issues between components, make sure all components are using the same version tag.

### Rollback Procedure

If you need to rollback to a previous version:

1. Update your `.env` file with the previous version tag
2. Pull the previous version's images:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

3. Restart the stack:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

4. If you've made database changes, you may need to restore from your backup:

```bash
# Stop the stack
docker-compose down

# Restore database (adjust parameters as needed)
cat karrio_backup_YYYYMMDD.sql | docker-compose exec -T db psql -U postgres -d db

# Start the stack
docker-compose up -d
```

## Checking Your Current Version

To check which version of Karrio you're currently running:

```bash
docker-compose exec api karrio version
```

Or check the image tags:

```bash
docker ps --format "{{.Names}}: {{.Image}}"
```
