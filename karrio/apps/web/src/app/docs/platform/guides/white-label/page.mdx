These settings affect:
- Browser title

- Platform references throughout the UI

### 2. Environment Variables

You can also configure white label settings through environment variables:

```env
# .env file
APP_NAME="Your Company Shipping"
APP_WEBSITE="https://yourcompany.com"
```

After updating environment variables, restart your services:
```bash
docker compose restart
```

## What Gets Branded

When you configure the platform name and website:

1. **Dashboard Header** - Shows your platform name
2. **Browser Title** - Uses your platform name
3. **Email Communications** - Sent from your platform name
4. **Login Page** - Displays your platform name
5. **API Responses** - Include your platform information in metadata

## Limitations

Currently, white labeling is limited to:
- Platform name configuration
- Website URL configuration

The following are **not** currently customizable:
- Logo and favicon
- Color schemes
- CSS styling
- Email templates
- Custom domains (requires manual server configuration)

## Future Enhancements

We're working on expanding white label capabilities to include:
- Custom logo support
- Theme customization
- Email template editing
- Advanced branding options

## Example Configuration

Here's a simple example of white labeling for a company called "FastShip":

1. **Set Platform Name**: "FastShip"
2. **Set Website URL**: "https://fastship.com"

Result:
- Users see "FastShip" in the dashboard header
- Browser tabs show "FastShip - Shipping Platform"
- System emails come from "FastShip"

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use a custom domain?

Custom domains require server-level configuration and are not available through the white label settings. You'll need to:
1. Configure your DNS
2. Set up SSL certificates
3. Update server configuration files
4. Modify environment variables

### Can I change the logo?

Logo customization is not currently available through the admin interface. This feature is planned for a future release.

### Do white label settings affect the API?

White label settings are included in API metadata responses but do not change API endpoints or functionality.

### Can different organizations have different branding?

No, white label settings apply to the entire platform instance. Multi-tenant branding is not currently supported.
