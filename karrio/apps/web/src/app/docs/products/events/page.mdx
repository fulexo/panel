Every Karrio Insiders project comes with comprehensive event management and real-time streaming capabilities, providing event-driven architecture, real-time data synchronization, complete event history, and custom event handlers for complex automation workflows.

## Features

### Real-Time Event Processing

You don't have to constantly check for status updates. Our event system instantly publishes notifications when shipping activities occur, enabling immediate responses and real-time user experiences.

### Event Streaming

Continuous event streams for real-time processing with high-throughput, low-latency delivery to multiple subscribers.

### Complete Event History

Comprehensive audit trail of all system events with searchable history and detailed event metadata for compliance and debugging.

### Custom Event Handlers

Build custom logic to respond to events with flexible event routing and transformation capabilities.

### Advanced Event Filtering

Subscribe only to relevant events with powerful filtering by event type, metadata, and custom criteria.

### Additional features

- Karrio extends events with custom event routing and transformation pipelines.
- Every event includes structured metadata and correlation IDs for tracing.
- Karrio manages event ordering and guaranteed delivery with replay capabilities.
- Support for event aggregation and batch processing for high-volume scenarios.

### JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

Using the Karrio SDK to access events:

```typescript
import { useEvents, useEvent } from '@karrio/hooks';

// Query events with filtering
const EventsComponent = () => {
  const { query, filter, setFilter } = useEvents({
    type: ['shipment.created', 'tracking.status_updated'],
    offset: 0,
    first: 20
  });

  if (query.isLoading) return <div>Loading events...</div>;
  if (query.error) return <div>Error loading events</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>System Events</h3>
      {query.data?.events.edges.map(({ node: event }) => (
        <div key={event.id}>
          <p>{event.type} - {event.created_at}</p>
          <p>Test mode: {event.test_mode ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
          <p>Pending webhooks: {event.pending_webhooks}</p>
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(event.data, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

// Get single event
const EventDetailComponent = ({ eventId }) => {
  const { query } = useEvent(eventId);

  if (query.isLoading) return <div>Loading event...</div>;
  if (query.error) return <div>Error loading event</div>;

  const event = query.data?.event;

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Event Details</h3>
      <p>ID: {event?.id}</p>
      <p>Type: {event?.type}</p>
      <p>Created: {event?.created_at}</p>
      <p>Test mode: {event?.test_mode ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(event?.data, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Event Types & Structure

Events in Karrio follow a standardized structure with event-specific data payloads. All events include the same base fields with type-specific data:

### Common Event Structure

```json
{
  "id": "evt_unique_identifier",
  "type": "event.type",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data payload
  },
  "test_mode": false,
  "pending_webhooks": 0,
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Available Event Types

Based on the Karrio event system, the following event types are supported:

- **shipment.created**: When a new shipment is created
- **shipment.updated**: When shipment details are modified
- **shipment.cancelled**: When a shipment is cancelled
- **tracking.updated**: When tracking information changes
- **order.created**: When a new order is created
- **order.fulfilled**: When an order is marked as fulfilled
- **webhook.delivered**: When a webhook is successfully delivered
- **webhook.failed**: When webhook delivery fails

## Real-Time Event Processing

### Event-Driven Workflows

Build reactive systems that respond immediately to shipping events:

```typescript
// Event-driven order fulfillment
class EventDrivenFulfillment {
  async handleShipmentCreated(event) {
    const { shipment } = event.data;

    // Update order status
    await this.updateOrderStatus(shipment.reference, "shipped");

    // Notify customer
    await this.sendShippingNotification(shipment);

    // Update inventory
    await this.decrementInventory(shipment.line_items);
  }

  async handleTrackingUpdated(event) {
    const { tracking } = event.data;

    if (tracking.status === "delivered") {
      // Complete order
      await this.completeOrder(tracking.reference);

      // Request review
      await this.requestCustomerReview(tracking.recipient);

      // Analytics tracking
      await this.trackDeliveryMetrics(tracking);
    }
  }
}
```

### Event Correlation

Track related events across the system:

````typescript
// Correlate events across shipment lifecycle
class EventCorrelator {
  async trackShipmentJourney(shipmentId) {
    const events = await this.getShipmentEvents(shipmentId);

    const journey = events.reduce((timeline, event) => {
      timeline.push({
        timestamp: event.created_at,
        type: event.type,
        status: this.extractStatus(event),
        location: this.extractLocation(event)
      });
      return timeline;
    }, []);

    return {
      shipment_id: shipmentId,
      timeline: journey.sort((a, b) =>
        new Date(a.timestamp) - new Date(b.timestamp)
      ),
      current_status: journey[journey.length - 1]?.status,
      total_events: events.length
    };
  }
}
```
