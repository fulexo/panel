**A White Paper by Karrio, Inc.**

---

## Executive Summary

In today's rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape, shipping has become a critical competitive differentiator. Yet, the integration of shipping functionality remains one of the most challenging technical hurdles facing platforms, logistics providers, and enterprises. Traditional shipping solutions are marked by arcane technologies, inconsistent APIs, and poor developer experiences that hinder innovation and growth.

Karrio emerged as an open-source solution to address these challenges, providing a unified API for shipping that abstracts the complexity of carrier integrations. After achieving significant traction with over beyond a million live transactions (live-rates, label-generation, live-tracking) per year and 5,00~ monthly open-source downloads, we're now introducing **Karrio Platform** – a sustainable, enterprise-ready evolution of our shipping infrastructure.

This white paper outlines our journey, the gaps we're addressing in the market, and our vision for creating an open logistics network that empowers businesses to build exceptional shipping experiences without the traditional pain points of carrier integration.

Karrio demonstrated remarkable growth and adoption last year:

### API Transaction Milestone

We've surpassed **1 million live API combined transactions** across our core services:

- Label generation
- Package tracking
- Live carrier rating

### Open Source Community Adoption

- **10,000~** OSS downloads
- A growing community of developers and logistics professionals network around the project

These metrics validate our approach and confirm the market need for a modern, developer-first shipping infrastructure. However, our growth has also highlighted challenges that have limited our ability to serve all customer needs at scale.

## Where We Fell Short and What's Changing

### The Unsustainable Open Source Model

While our open-source approach has driven adoption, it presented sustainability challenges:

- **Limited Development Resources**: With a single core maintainer, we couldn't keep pace with feature requests and carrier integration needs
- **Incomplete Enterprise Features**: Critical functionality like custom rate sheets, workflow automation, and batch operations remained in beta
- **Integration Gaps**: Many carrier integrations lacked production readiness or comprehensive testing
- **Support Limitations**: Without a sustainable funding model, we couldn't provide the enterprise-grade support that businesses require

### The Path Forward

These challenges have led us to evolve our business model while preserving our commitment to openness and developer experience:

- **Transitioning Beyond Pure OSS**: Introducing a sustainable platform that funds ongoing development and support
- **Expanding Our Team**: Growing from a single maintainer to a dedicated team of shipping technology experts
- **Prioritizing Enterprise Readiness**: Focusing on stability, security, and scalability for mission-critical shipping operations
- **Comprehensive Carrier Program**: Building deeper, more robust carrier integrations with thorough testing and certification
