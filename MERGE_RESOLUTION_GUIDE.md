## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Merge via GitHub (Recommended)

If you have a Pull Request open:

1. **Check CI/CD Status**
   - Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
   - Ensure all checks pass

2. **Review Conflicts on GitHub**
   - GitHub will show any conflicts
   - Use GitHub's conflict editor if needed

3. **Merge Strategy**
   - Use "Squash and merge" for clean history
   - Or "Create merge commit" to preserve all commits

### Option 2: Merge Locally

If you need to merge locally first:

```bash
# Ensure you're on your branch
git checkout cursor/panel-project-error-review-and-correction-6396

# Fetch latest main
git fetch origin main

# Try merging main into your branch
git merge origin/main

# If conflicts occur, resolve them and:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge main into feature branch"

# Push the merge
git push origin cursor/panel-project-error-review-and-correction-6396
```

### Option 3: Rebase Strategy (Clean History)

For a cleaner history:

```bash
# Backup current branch
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Rebase onto main
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts, resolve each one:
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue

# Force push (only if you're sure!)
git push origin cursor/panel-project-error-review-and-correction-6396 --force-with-lease
```

## Common Merge Failure Causes

### 1. Branch Protection Rules
- Main branch may require:
  - ✅ Passing CI/CD checks
  - ✅ Code review approval
  - ✅ Up-to-date with base branch

**Solution:** Wait for checks to pass and get approval

### 2. Merge Conflicts
- Same lines modified in both branches

**Solution:** Resolve conflicts manually

### 3. Large Number of Changes
- GitHub may have trouble with 26+ file changes

**Solution:** Review changes carefully, ensure all are intentional

### 4. CI/CD Failures
- Tests or linting may be failing

**Solution:** Check GitHub Actions tab for errors

---

## Specific File Conflict Resolution

If specific files have conflicts, here's how to resolve common ones:

### README.md Conflicts
- Keep all new badges and status sections
- Merge documentation links
- Preserve both changes if possible

### package.json Conflicts  
- Keep version numbers from main
- Merge dependency changes
- Preserve script additions

### .env Files
- Never commit production secrets
- Keep local development values
- Use .env.example for templates

## Pre-Merge Checklist

Before merging, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] ESLint passes with 0 errors
- [ ] Documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] No sensitive data in commits
- [ ] Commit messages are clear
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with main

## Post-Merge Actions

After successful merge:

1. **Delete the feature branch**
   ```bash
   git branch -d cursor/panel-project-error-review-and-correction-6396
   git push origin --delete cursor/panel-project-error-review-and-correction-6396
   ```

2. **Update local main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Verify deployment**
   - Check CI/CD pipeline
   - Verify production deployment (if auto-deploy enabled)

---

## Emergency: Abort Merge

If you need to abort a failed merge:

```bash
# Abort ongoing merge
git merge --abort

# Or abort rebase
git rebase --abort

# Clean working directory
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd
```
