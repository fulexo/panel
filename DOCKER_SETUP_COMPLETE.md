## 📝 Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Access web panel: http://localhost:3001
2. ✅ Login with admin credentials
3. ✅ Verify dashboard loads
4. ✅ Test basic navigation

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Test all core features
2. Verify API endpoints
3. Test database operations
4. Review logs for errors
5. Performance testing

### Medium Term (This Month)
1. User onboarding flow
2. Production deployment planning
3. SSL certificate configuration
4. Environment hardening
5. Backup strategy implementation

### Production Preparation
1. Use docker-compose.yml or docker-compose.prod.yml
2. Set up proper SSL certificates
3. Configure production domains
4. Use strong security credentials
5. Set up monitoring and alerting
6. Implement backup procedures

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Development Environment
- Currently running in HTTP (not HTTPS)
- Uses development-friendly credentials
- All default values suitable for local development
- No SSL certificates required

### Before Production
- Change all default passwords
- Generate strong JWT_SECRET and ENCRYPTION_KEY
- Configure SSL certificates
- Review security settings
- Set up proper monitoring
- Implement backup strategy
- Configure firewall rules

### Data Persistence
- All data stored in Docker volumes
- Volumes survive container restarts
- Use `docker-compose down -v` to clear data
- Regular backups recommended

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# Check Docker Compose file syntax
docker-compose config

# View container error logs
docker logs container_name
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify database is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Test connection
docker exec compose-postgres-1 psql -U fulexo_user -d fulexo -c "SELECT 1"
```

### Cache Issues
```bash
# Verify Redis/Valkey is running
docker exec compose-valkey-1 redis-cli ping

# Check Redis memory
docker exec compose-valkey-1 redis-cli info memory
```

### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check what's using port 3001
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Change port mapping in docker-compose.yml if needed
```
